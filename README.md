This repository holds the enhanced codebase for Category Three: Databases. The original code originates from work created in IT-145: Foundation in Application Development. This was first expanded upon in Enhancement One, which added the GUI framework and data persistence
in the form of JSON files. In this enhancement, the JSON file I/O is replaced with the use of a database, specifically MongoDB. Also, this code was further enhanced with the implementation of user authentication, role-based access control, and advanced security features, such as password hashing.
